            "summary": "Spaceflight-induced vertebral bone loss in ovariectomized rats is associated with increased bone marrow adiposity. \nThe bone loss is due to increased bone resorption with no change in bone formation. \nOvariectomized rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher marrow adipose tissue. \nThe increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number and size. \nMineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. \nThe findings indicate that cancellous bone loss during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and marrow adiposity. \nThe results suggest that mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts during spaceflight.",

            "summary": "The Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) was tested for its ability to support rodents for up to 35 days. \nThe study found that the AEM could support 12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for 35 days with self-contained food and water. \nThe AEM also supported 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of food and water. \nNo significant differences were found in animal health evaluations, growth, and body masses between AEM-housed and vivarium-housed animals. \nThe results demonstrated the capability and flexibility of the AEM to operate for up to 35 days with minor hardware modifications. \nThe study showed that the AEM can be used for extended operational periods, making it suitable for use on the International Space Station or other spaceflight vehicles. \nThe AEM's ability to support rodents for extended periods has implications for long-term space life science research, enabling studies of up to 90 days.",
