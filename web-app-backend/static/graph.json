            "summary": "The Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) was tested for its ability to support rodents for up to 35 days. \nThe study found that the AEM could support 12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for 35 days with self-contained food and water. \nThe AEM also supported 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of food and water. \nNo significant differences were found in animal health evaluations, growth, and body masses between AEM-housed and vivarium-housed animals. \nThe results demonstrated the capability and flexibility of the AEM to operate for up to 35 days with minor hardware modifications. \nThe study showed that the AEM can be used for extended operational periods, making it suitable for use on the International Space Station or other spaceflight vehicles. \nThe AEM's ability to support rodents for extended periods has implications for long-term space life science research, enabling studies of up to 90 days.",
